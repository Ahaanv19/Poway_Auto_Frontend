  <h1>About Poway Auto</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Poway Auto</strong> is an intelligent, community-driven navigation platform created to enhance commuting experiences in Poway, California.
    Whether you're headed to school, work, or anywhere in between, Poway Auto helps you travel smarter by combining real-time traffic data,
