Daily Routine Page Documentation
Overview
- The Daily Routine page allows users to create, save, and view a persistent full-day schedule of routes.

- Users can add multiple routes per hour with start and destination locations.

- The schedule is stored in localStorage, so it persists across browser sessions.

- The page includes an interactive map showing the current hour’s first route visually.

Key Features
- Add routes for each hour of the day (0 to 23 hours).

- Display a table with each hour and the corresponding routes.

- Edit or delete routes individually.

- Show the current hour’s first route on a Leaflet map, updating every minute.

- Geocode location names to latitude/longitude using OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim API.

- Routing displayed with Leaflet Routing Machine.
