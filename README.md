# Advanced Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System for San Diego

The proposed **Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System** leverages real-time mapping, AI-driven traffic analysis, and predictive routing to optimize travel in San Diego. This system is designed to be intuitive for users, enabling them to input a start and end location to generate the most efficient route. The system integrates real-time traffic data to adjust routes dynamically, accounting for congestion, accidents, and other factors that could impact travel time. A simulation model will be included to visualize how real-world traffic conditions affect route selection and driving strategies.

## Key Features of the System

### 1. Real-Time Mapping Integration
The system will integrate **high-resolution maps** of San Diego, providing an up-to-date representation of roads, intersections, and urban infrastructure. The mapping data will be continuously refreshed to ensure accuracy, and will be combined with **satellite imagery** to improve situational awareness. This real-time mapping will act as the foundation for the AI’s routing decisions.

### 2. AI-Driven Traffic Analysis
The AI-driven traffic analysis system will process real-time traffic data to predict congestion and adjust routes accordingly. It will use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve its predictions based on new data. This feature will ensure that the autonomous vehicle can react dynamically to traffic changes, accidents, and other delays.

### 3. Predictive Routing
The system will employ **predictive routing algorithms** to determine the best route based on real-time traffic conditions, historical data, and predictive traffic flow models. It will also factor in the vehicle’s ability to navigate congested roads, optimizing for both time and fuel efficiency.

### 4. Simulation Model
A **simulation model** will be integrated into the system to demonstrate how the vehicle’s AI adjusts routes based on dynamic traffic conditions. The simulation will allow for testing under various real-world scenarios to assess the system’s accuracy and reliability.
