## 🌆 Target City
**City of Poway** – This project is tailored specifically for Poway, with a focus on enhancing transportation both **within** the city and **outward to neighboring regions** using intelligent routing systems.

## 🔍 Core Interest
We aim to develop a location-aware application that:
- Is designed **exclusively for Poway**, but communicates efficiently with **external routing networks**.
- Leverages real-time traffic data to enable smarter route planning for **vehicles exiting Poway**.

## 🔧 Technical Approach
- Integrate the **Google Maps API** for dynamic routing.
- Utilize **Poway-specific transportation and infrastructure datasets**.
- Build machine learning models to optimize routes and predict congestion patterns beyond city boundaries.

## 🤝 Strategic Partnerships
- **City of Poway**: Collaboration for data access, city-specific routing logic, and pilot testing support.
- **Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Companies**: Provide a real-world use case by enabling AV fleets like Qualcomms Autonomous Vehicles to navigate efficiently out of Poway using our platform.

## 🎯 Product Vision
Create a **next-gen mobility platform** that connects:
- **City governments** seeking traffic relief and infrastructure optimization.
- **AV companies** in need of localized, real-time routing intelligence.
- **Tech partners like Qualcomm** pushing the frontier of autonomous driving.

This app becomes a testbed and model for integrating smart city data with AV technology.

## 📈 Pitch to City of Poway
By supporting this initiative, Poway can:
- Become a **pioneer city for autonomous vehicle deployment**.
- Attract innovation-focused investment from companies like **Qualcomm** and AV startups.
- Improve safety, reduce travel time, and modernize its transportation strategy.

## ⏳ Timeline: Summer Milestone
- Allocate summer months to build the prototype.
- Use this period for collaboration with Poway city officials, Qualcomm, and AV partners.
- Present a working proof of concept as a **milestone achievement**.
