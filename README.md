# QCOMM Auto: Design Process  
*Advanced Route Optimization and Adaptive Driving Experiences*

---

## Phase 1: Problem Discovery & Research

### Objective  
Understand the core challenges of autonomous vehicle navigation and user experience. Identify gaps in current route planning technologies and assess real-world conditions that impact routing and personalization.

### Key Activities  
- Analyzed traffic inefficiencies using datasets from Poway’s Open Data Portal and Caltrans feeds  
- Studied human driving behaviors and preferences through user interviews and surveys  
- Evaluated existing solutions in autonomous driving and smart navigation systems

## Phase 2: System Architecture & Planning

### Objective  
Design a modular and scalable system architecture capable of ingesting real-time data, adapting to user behaviors, and supporting on-vehicle intelligence.

### Key Components  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separated services for routing, UI, user preference tracking, and ML inference  
- **Edge-AI Readiness**: Hardware selection (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Snapdragon) for low-latency processing  
- **Secure Communication Layer**: JWT-authenticated APIs and encrypted sensor data streams  
- **Docker + CI/CD Pipelines**: Infrastructure to support iterative development and cloud deployment

## Phase 3: Route Optimization Engine

### Objective  
Develop a predictive routing system that calculates optimal paths in real-time, accounting for environmental and traffic conditions.

### Core Features  
- **Predictive Algorithms**: Use historical and real-time data to optimize ETA and fuel efficiency  
- **Traffic Flow Modeling**: Ingest data from V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) sensors and municipal sources  
- **Multi-Objective Pathfinding**: Balance shortest route, energy usage, stops, and risk levels

## Phase 4: User-Centric Experience Layer

### Objective  
Create a personalized driving experience by learning from user behavior and preferences.

### Core Features  
- **Favorite Locations & Recurring Routes**: Auto-prioritize user-preferred paths  
- **Personalized Route Suggestions**: Account for weather, traffic, and avoidance rules (e.g. toll roads)  
- **Context-Aware Driving Modes**: Customize driving style (cautious, assertive) per user profile  
- **Integrated Dashboard**: Visual interface for route history, preferences, and recommendations

## Phase 5: Machine Learning & Edge AI Integration

### Objective  
Enable intelligent decision-making on the vehicle itself using real-time inference and adaptive learning.

### Core Features  
- **On-Device Model Inference**: For routing, user behavior prediction, and obstacle avoidance  
- **Federated Learning Pipelines**: Enable learning across fleets while maintaining data privacy  
- **Model Retraining Workflows**: Incorporate new user data for continuous improvement

## Phase 6: System Deployment & Scaling

### Objective  
Ensure that the system can be deployed reliably across environments and scale with project growth.

### Deployment Stack  
- **Containerized Services**: For modular updates and isolated environments  
- **Edge Hardware Acceleration**: Snapdragon/NVIDIA Jetson for onboard processing  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate testing, builds, and releases across dev clusters  
- **Encrypted Communication Protocols**: Secure API channels and sandboxed service zones

## Phase 7: Evaluation, Feedback, and Future Iterations

### Objective  
Continuously improve the system based on real-world use, driver feedback, and performance metrics.

### Next Steps  
- Conduct pilot testing with simulated and real road conditions  
- Gather feedback on personalized features and UI accessibility  
- Expand traffic data ingestion to include more city and state sources  
- Improve long-term planning algorithms for multi-stop and recurrent travel scenarios
